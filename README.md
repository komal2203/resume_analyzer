# 📝 JobMatcher PRO

Welcome to **JobMatcher Pro**, an end-to-end intelligent resume classification platform leveraging NLP and machine learning to automate and enhance the recruitment process.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

JobMatcher Pro is designed to **automatically classify resumes** into predefined job categories, streamlining the screening process for recruiters and HR professionals. The system extracts text from uploaded resumes (PDF/DOCX), preprocesses it, and uses advanced ML models to predict the most suitable job category. The platform provides a modern web interface, supports multiple classification models, and displays confidence scores for predictions.

- **PDF Parsing:** PyPDF2
- **Data Storage:** Recent uploads tracked in JSON
- **Deployment:** Docker-ready

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla), Jinja2 Templates
- **Backend:** Python 3, FastAPI, Uvicorn
- **NLP & ML:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud, nltk
- **PDF Extraction:** PyPDF2

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

The following models are trained and available for selection:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest** (with per-class confidence scores)

**Feature Extraction:**  
All models use TF-IDF vectorization for transforming resume text into numerical features.

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Data Preparation & Preprocessing**
   - Clean and normalize resume text (remove URLs, special chars, stopwords, etc.)
   - Visualize data distribution and word clouds for insights

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Apply TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into feature vectors

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Train multiple classifiers (KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
   - Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix
   - Save trained models and vectorizer with joblib

4. **API & Web Interface**
   - FastAPI backend serves a modern web UI for uploading resumes and selecting models
   - Extracts text from PDF/DOCX, preprocesses, predicts category, and displays results
   - For Random Forest, shows confidence scores for each class

5. **Recent Uploads**
   - Tracks last 5 uploads with filename, model, prediction, and timestamp

6. **Deployment**
   - Dockerfile provided for easy containerization and deployment

---

## 🌐 Web Interface Features

- **Upload Resume:** Supports PDF (and optionally DOCX)
- **Model Selection:** Choose from 5 ML models
- **Prediction Display:** Shows predicted class and, for Random Forest, confidence scores per class
- **Recent Uploads:** Sidebar with last 5 predictions
- **Responsive Design:** Clean, modern, and mobile-friendly

---

## 🐳 Docker Support

Easily containerize and deploy the app:

```bash
docker build -t intellicv-app .
docker run -p 8000:8000 intellicv-app
```
